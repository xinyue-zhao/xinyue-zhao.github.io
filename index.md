## Short Biography
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. My research interests lie in the field of partial differential equations (PDEs) and applied mathematics. In particular, I am interested in using mathematical tools, both theoretical and numerical, to analyze biological and physical models and discover exciting implications from these models.
