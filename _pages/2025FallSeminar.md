Title: Numerical Optimal Control of Metastatic Cancer Treatment Models
Abstract: We propose a unified size-structured PDE model for metastatic tumor growth, extending a well-known coupled ODEâ€“PDE framework from the literature. Using optimal control theory, we investigate a treatment model based on this formulation, derive the first-order necessary optimality system, and show that the uniqueness of the optimal control depends on the chosen objective functional. To improve computational efficiency, we reformulate the transport PDE model as a lumped ODE system that incorporates a Volterra integral equation of convolution type, independent of the control variable. This reduction allows computation of aggregated tumor dynamics without explicit spatial dependence. Nonlinear pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of treatment are also incorporated into the lumped model. Numerical experiments demonstrate biologically relevant treatment outcomes across different models and control strategies.
