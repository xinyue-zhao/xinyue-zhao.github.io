Title: Numerical Optimal Control of Metastatic Cancer Treatment Models

Abstract: We propose a unified size-structured PDE model for metastatic tumor growth, extending a well-known coupled ODE–PDE framework from the literature. Using optimal control theory, we investigate a treatment model based on this formulation, derive the first-order necessary optimality system, and show that the uniqueness of the optimal control depends on the chosen objective functional. To improve computational efficiency, we reformulate the transport PDE model as a lumped ODE system that incorporates a Volterra integral equation of convolution type, independent of the control variable. This reduction allows computation of aggregated tumor dynamics without explicit spatial dependence. Nonlinear pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of treatment are also incorporated into the lumped model. Numerical experiments demonstrate biologically relevant treatment outcomes across different models and control strategies.

Title: Global well-posedness and concentrated steady states in chemotaxis-fluid models

Abstract: Chemotaxis is a process by which bacteria direct their movement in response to chemical stimulus gradients.  To describe this phenomenon, E. Keller and L. Segel in the 1970s proposed a class of strongly coupled parabolic PDEs, now known as Keller-Segel (KS) models. Due to their relatively simple structures yet rich dynamical behaviors, KS systems have attracted extensive attention, with numerous studies devoted to the qualitative properties of the solutions, including global well-posedness, singularity formation, etc. In this talk, we focus on a class of Keller–Segel–Navier–Stokes (KS-NS) systems, which serve as a paradigm for modeling the chemotactic movement of bacteria in a viscous fluid.  Under the assumption of small cellular initial mass, we establish the existence of global-in-time solutions to the two-dimensional KS–NS system by employing the entropy–dissipation method.   Moreover, we construct spot steady states at the critical mass threshold for the cellular density using the inner–outer gluing approach.

Title: Agent-Based and Continuous Models of Locust Hopper Bands

Abstract: An outstanding challenge in mathematical biology is using laboratory and/or field observations to tune a model’s functional form and parameter values. These problems lie at the intersection of dynamical systems and data science. In this talk I will discuss an ongoing project developing models of the Australian plague locust for which excellent field data is available. Under favorable environmental conditions flightless juveniles aggregate into coherent, aligned swarms referred to as hopper bands. We develop two models of hopper bands in tandem; an agent-based model that tracks the position of individuals and a continuum model describing locust density. By examining 4.4 million parameter combinations, we identify a set of parameters that reproduce field observations.

I will then discuss ongoing efforts to improve these models. The first extends this work by modeling locust alignment via the Kuramoto model of oscillator synchronization. The second uses motion tracking of tens of thousands of locusts to shed light on how locust movement is influenced by social interactions. Finally, we reflect on how recent lab work is revolutionizing our understanding of locust visual perception and navigation, spawning a new class of agent-based models.
