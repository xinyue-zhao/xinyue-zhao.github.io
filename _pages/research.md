My research includes theoretical and numerical analysis for partial differential equations (PDEs) with real-world applications. In particular, I mainly focus on the topics of stability and bifurcation since these two topics are of practical importance in applications. The following are some projects I did:


### 1. Tumor growth model with a time delay in cell proliferation [ <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/project1">Details</a> ]


### 2. Atherosclerosis [ <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/project2">Details</a> ]


### 3. Solving free boundary systems by using neural networks [ <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/project3">Details</a> ]


### 4. A nonlinear cell-cell adhesion model [ <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/project4">Details</a> ]
