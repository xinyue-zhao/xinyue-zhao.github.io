Title: Systems modeling integrates scarce, discordant observations to uncover quantitative answers in the qualitative data describing plant Fe homeostasis

Abstract: Iron (Fe) plays a catalytic role in all primary metabolic processes. But Fe is a potent redox agent that can generate reactive oxygen species, promoting the destruction of structural and functional biomolecules. Hence, Fe uptake, bioavailability, and localization must be tightly controlled in response to changing developmental and physiological needs. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, BRUTUS (BTS), is an iron-binding ubiquitin ligase protein thought to choreograph Fe deficiency responses across the plant while being confined to the plant vasculature. The protein’s abundance and activity respond to physiological Fe, but the molecular evidence about its function seems to contradict the organismal evidence about its role in Fe regulation. Phenotypic observations suggest that BTS acts as a brake on mechanisms that drive Fe uptake: when BTS is knocked down, the plant accumulates more iron. However, molecular data indicate that BTS is normally upregulated in the setting of Fe deficiency.  

In vitro studies have reported BTS destabilization as Fe levels increase. By contrast, live-cell imaging reveals increased cytosolic BTS as Fe levels increase. Furthermore, mutations that partially abrogate Fe binding produce divergent levels of cytosolic and nuclear BTS. Using mathematical modeling as a formal, testable sense-making strategy – at the core of an iterative modeling-experimentation loop – we identified a kinetic regime under which Fe-responsive stability and translocation of BTS could concurrently explain this group of empirical observations. Supported by further validation of our model’s predictions, we posit that BTS abundance is a non-monotonic function of Fe status, defined by competing effects of Fe-mediated stability, proteasomal degradation, and Fe-stimulated nuclear translocation.

Title: Models of the Spread of Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever and the Treatment of Metastatic Cancer via Neoantigen Vaccine

Abstract: In this talk I will present two distinct projects: The first is an ODE-based model of  Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), a tick-borne illness that affects animals and humans across the globe. Our model captures transmission among three life stages of ticks, humans, cattle, and small mammals, as well as co-feeding transmission dynamics. We adapt this model to Uganda’s Cattle Corridor, a region in Uganda categorized by cattle farming with high prevalence of CCHF. This project was partially supported by the MASAMU program with funding from a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant based at Auburn University. The second project is a coupled ODE-PDE model of metastatic cancer treatment with neoantigen cancer vaccine. We use a system of ordinary differential equations to model the treatment of a primary tumor, and couple the system with a partial differential equation that tracks the number of metastases per time and size. Vaccine dosage is taken as a control in the ODE system to decrease the primary tumor burden and in turn, slow the spread of metastases. An optimal control problem is formulated to design vaccine treatment. 

Numerical simulations of both models will be presented as well.
