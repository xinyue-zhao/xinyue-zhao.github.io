## 4. A nonlinear cell-cell adhesion model

A nonlinear partial differential equation containing a nonlocal advection term and a diffusion term is analyzed to study wound closure outcomes in wound healing experiments. There is an extensive literature of similar models for wound healing experiments. In this project, we study the character of wound closure in these experiments in terms of the sensing radius of cells and the force of cell-cell adhesion.
