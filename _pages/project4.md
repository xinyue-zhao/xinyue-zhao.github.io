## 3. A nonlinear cell-cell adhesion model

A nonlinear partial differential equation containing a nonlocal advection term and a diffusion term is analyzed to study complete and incomplete wound closure outcomes in wound healing experiments. Over the last few decades, the model was studied in an extensive literature, and the existence, regularity, positivity, boundedness, and asymptotic behavior of its solution have been established [Dyson et.al., 2010]. However, the stability results obtained in the literature are sufficient, but not necessary. In this project, we considered the bifurcations around a trivial steady state solution, and based on the bifurcation results, we derived the both sufficient and necessary condition for the trivial solution to be stable. Overall, we proved the existence of bifurcation solutions, and obtained a series of bifurcation points. We showed that there exists a critical value of the cell-cell adhesion constant $\lambda_\star$, such that the steady state solution $u\equiv1$ is linearly stable if $\lambda<\lambda_\star$, and unstable if $\lambda>\lambda_*$. More importantly, the critical value $\lambda_*$ is the smallest bifurcation point obtained in the series of bifurcation points. Numerical simulations are also provided to validate the results.
