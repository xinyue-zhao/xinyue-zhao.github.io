A nonlinear partial differential equation containing a nonlocal advection term and a diffusion term is analyzed to study wound closure outcomes in wound healing experiments. A wound healing assay is done by making a scratch on a cell monolayer and capturing images at regular time intervals. There can be different outcomes for these experiments. Even though they all start from almost uniformly-wound edges, some result in uniform wound closure, while in other cases, the leading edges are nonuniform. In order to explain different wound healing outcomes, we considered a nonlocal PDE and carried out bifurcation and stability analysis. Our analysis shows that higher cell-cell adhesion force corresponds to nonuniform edges in wound closure.
